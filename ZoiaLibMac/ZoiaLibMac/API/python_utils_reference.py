/// The following utils are python code that is needed to 'convert' the JSON used by

/// json parsers - theses snippets are meant to be inserted into zoia_lib/backend/patch_binary.py
/// immediately following the loading of ModuleIndex.json:

/// The following snippet is need because python supports dereferencing of dictionaries using an ordered naming convention
/// i.e., in python, the value referenced by dict[0][1] - would return the second item in the object or array of the
/// first item in the 'dict' dictionary.
///
/// This inherent "ordering" of dictionaries is not supported by Swift (or many other langauges) - as Swift is very specific that
/// dictionaries are not ordered and can only be referenced by their keys.
///
/// So what this does is read in the ModuleIndex.json file and create a new json file that uses an array
/// to store the "options" of each Module - as json arrays parsed by Swift are guaranteed to be ordered
