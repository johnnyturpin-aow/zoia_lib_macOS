This is a native macOS patch manager / librarian for the Empress Effects ZOIA / Euroburo modular effects unit. It is written in Swift/SwiftUI which is currently (and unfortunately) not cross-platform. It is a "spiritual" fork / companion to the cross-platform (python/qt) ZOIA Librarian which can be found here: [https://github.com/meanmedianmoge/zoia_lib](https://github.com/meanmedianmoge/zoia_lib)

There is no code shared between the two projects, though the original was invaluable in helping to figure out the ZOIA patch file format - we do share the common goal of making patch management for the ZOIA as easy as possible.

## Developement Environment

This is a modern SwiftUI macOS native application. As such, it has some unfortunately hefty requirements (imposed by Apple not by the developers).

**This application requires Xcode >= 13.3 and macOS Monterey**

## Documentation

A user guide with tips & tricks is available here [User Guide](/docs/

Documentation of the ZOIA binary format as well as original testing and design documents for the original project from Empress Effects can be found in the [docs](/docs/macOS%20UserGuide.md) folder.

## Contributing
We welcome all contributions! If you want to see something added, 
either fork or clone the repo to get started. SwiftUI is currently a wild frontier / cutting edge technology from Apple, and as such, has bugs and quirks that require lots of trial and error. You have been warned. It is fun though.
